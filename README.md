## Introduction

### What are the project requirements?	

## Finding the best dataset		

I have decided to get my data from [BigQuery public datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data?_ga=2.180085732.-1903192553.1663671110) because I wanted to test a hypothesis that I initially formulated: 

> "the quality of education positively affects the economic and social success of a country." 

I have chosen to use [Standard SQL language](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/introduction) to obtain and filter my initial dataset as it would make my subsequent data exploration in [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) faster. Moreover, BigQuery's SQL engine is powerful, which could also reduce the time I would spend exploring the initial data.
I have chosen to look at the [World Bank international education dataset](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038480) via BigQuery. The dataset has the necessary statistics, e.g., the student population in each country, and covers all the countries in 2022 and the different school sectors, e.g., Secondary, Primary, and so on.


The schema of the first data set I have used is screenshot below:

## Data cleaning and planning	
#### What are the current issues with my data and how do i plan to solve them?	
#### What tables do i need to join in order to prove my hypothesis?	
## Data visualization	
#### What different charts and graphs will i be using?	
## Data Exploration
#### What does the visulised data show about my chosen topic?	
## Review	
#### Do these findings support my hypothesis?	
#### Upon completing this project, do i still support my hypothesis?	
## Conclusion
