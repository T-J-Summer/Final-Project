## Introduction
#### What is the project requirements?	
#### What do i plan to investigate?	
## Finding the best dataset	
#### What dataset am I looking at in order to find this?	
I have decided to get my data from BigQuery public datasets because I wanted to test a hypothesis that I initially formulated: "the quality of education positively affects the economic and social success of a country." I have chosen to use SQL language to obtain and filter my data initial dataset as it would make my subsequent data exploration in Pandas faster. Moreover, BigQuery's SQL engine is powerful, which could also reduce the time I would spend exploring the initial data.
I have chosen to look at the World Bank international education dataset via BigQuery. The dataset has the necessary statistics, e.g., the student population in each country, and covers all the countries in 2022 and the different school sectors, e.g., Secondary, Primary, and so on.


internatinal_education - this dataset shows the education statistics for diffrent countries across the years.

The second dataset that i am going to look at is from the world bank, i chose to source information from here because it is a reperitable source and can be trusted. This dataset will enable me to see which countries are classed as high, middle or low income countries this then will enable me to match this data with the education datasets and establish whether there is a correlation between a countries income and their education population. 

#### Why have i chose this data?	
## Data cleaning and planning	
#### What are the current issues with my data and how do i plan to solve them?	
#### What tables do i need to join in order to prove my hypothesis?	
## Data visualization	
#### What different charts and graphs will i be using?	
## Data Exploration
#### What does the visulised data show about my chosen topic?	
## Review	
#### Do these findings support my hypothesis?	
#### Upon completing this project, do i still support my hypothesis?	
## Conclusion
