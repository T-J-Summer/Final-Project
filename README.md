## Introduction
#### What is the project requirements?	
#### What do i plan to investigate?	
I plan to look at education world wide and weather a countryâ€™s economic situation impacts the ability to educate children. In order to do this i will need two different datasets, one to look at the population of schools across the globe and the other to look at the economic position of different countries across the world.
After finding the two different datasets i am able to come up with a hypothesis that i think is the answer of the question above. My hypothesis is that the more money a country has, the higher the population of the schools in that country, the two different data sets that i pick will enable me to link my hypothesis to the final outcome of the data that i will be analysing. 

## Finding the best dataset	
#### What dataset am I looking at in order to find this?	
#### Why have i chose this data?	
## Data cleaning and planning	
#### What are the current issues with my data and how do i plan to solve them?	
#### What tables do i need to join in order to prove my hypothesis?	
## Data visualization	
#### What different charts and graphs will i be using?	
## Data Exploration
#### What does the visulised data show about my chosen topic?	
## Review	
#### Do these findings support my hypothesis?	
#### Upon completing this project, do i still support my hypothesis?	
## Conclusion
