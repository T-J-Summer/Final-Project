## Introduction

#### What are the project requirements?

This project has a set of requirements. I have listed them below and will review them at the end of the project to show how I have completed them:

- Use a dataset of a minimum of 1000 records.
- Provide evidence of data validity (explain the source of the data)
- Utilizing a minimum of 3 data technologies, e.g., [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en), [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/topic/9046002?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=1382883)
- Make Pull Requests reviewed by other team members
- Use data visualization: a minimum of 5 different types of data visualization from a minimum of 2 libraries, e.g., [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
- Document the project with a Readme
- Use some statistical or machine learning analysis, e.g., Linear regression Clustering or Classification
- Comment code blocks to explain their purpose
- Present the project using [slides.com](https://slides.com/)
## Finding the best dataset		

I have decided to get my data from [BigQuery public datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data?_ga=2.180085732.-1903192553.1663671110) because I wanted to test a hypothesis that I initially formulated: 

> "the quality of education positively affects the economic and social success of a country." 

I have chosen to use [Standard SQL language](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/introduction) to obtain and filter my initial dataset as it would make my subsequent data exploration in [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) faster. Moreover, BigQuery's SQL engine is powerful, which could also reduce the time I would spend exploring the initial data.
I have chosen to look at the [World Bank international education dataset](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038480) via BigQuery. The dataset has the necessary statistics, e.g., the student population in each country, and covers all the countries in 2022 and the different school sectors, e.g., Secondary, Primary, and so on.

## Data cleaning and planning	
#### What are the current issues with my data and how do i plan to solve them?	
#### What tables do i need to join in order to prove my hypothesis?	
## Data visualization	
#### What different charts and graphs will i be using?	
## Data Exploration
#### What does the visulised data show about my chosen topic?	
## Review	
#### Do these findings support my hypothesis?	
#### Upon completing this project, do i still support my hypothesis?	
## Conclusion
