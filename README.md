## Introduction
#### What is the project requirements?	
#### What do i plan to investigate?	
## Finding the best dataset	
#### What dataset am I looking at in order to find this?	
I have decided to get my data from Big Query public datasets because I wanted to explore global data in order to explore my question and answer wether my hypothesis is correct. I also wanted to use Google BgQuery for this data because I have been using it for the past 9 weeks and have found that it is extremely up to date with some data being recorded from 2-3 days ago.
Because of this i am choosing to look at the international data from BigQuery, i am going to use ‘internatinal_education’ because it has all the statistics regarding student population in each country, this dataset has all countries and the population of different school sectors (e.g. Secondary, Primary…). 


internatinal_education - this dataset shows the education statistics for diffrent countries across the years. 


The second dataset that i am going to look at is from the world bank, i chose to source information from here because it is a reperitable source and can be trusted. This dataset will enable me to see which countries are classed as high, middle or low income countries this then will enable me to match this data with the education datasets and establish whether there is a correlation between a countries income and their education population. 

#### Why have i chose this data?	
## Data cleaning and planning	
#### What are the current issues with my data and how do i plan to solve them?	
#### What tables do i need to join in order to prove my hypothesis?	
## Data visualization	
#### What different charts and graphs will i be using?	
## Data Exploration
#### What does the visulised data show about my chosen topic?	
## Review	
#### Do these findings support my hypothesis?	
#### Upon completing this project, do i still support my hypothesis?	
## Conclusion
